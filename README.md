# Data Structure and Algorithm
This repo contains codes of the lecture assignment of CST DSA 2023 autumn class in Tsinghua University, including 12 PA assignments and 4 labs.
## Data Structure
The `datastructure` directory contains the implementation of basic data sturctures:
- List
- Queue
- Bitmap
- Binary Tree(BT)
- Binary Search Tree(BST)
- AVL Tree
- Splay Tree
- Union-Find Set
- CompHeap
- LeftistHeap
## Algorithms
The `search` and `sort` directory contains the implementation of basic search and sort algorithms:
- Binary Search (lower bound and upper bound)
- Bubble Sort
- Insert Sort
- Merge Sort
- Selection Sort

The correctness of the codes have been verified by a few examples.
